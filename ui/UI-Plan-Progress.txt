* Display speech text in auto scrolling text box
-> Line by line animation
-> Auto Scroll
Play animation around logo when Julee is speaking

Progress:
(13/04/2022)
UI can change on demand, framework to add more logos is ready
Basic animation
(14/02/2022)
Text box can accept text from debug button, automatically create scroll bar (base qt function)

To be done:

Automatic Julee logo move away when functions logo are running
Automatic Julee logo return after functions logo are off
Connect GUI to back-end
Replace better Logo
Delete Debug buttons
